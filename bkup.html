          <p>Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. It is a lot of fun. Look at them little rascals.

          <p>If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Use what you see, don't plan it.</p>
